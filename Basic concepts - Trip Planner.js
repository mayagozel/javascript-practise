/*
You need to plan a road trip. You are traveling at an average speed of 40 miles an hour.
Given a distance in miles as input (the code to take input is already present), output to the console the time it will take you to cover it in minutes.
Sample Input:
150
Sample Output:
225
Explanation: It will take 150/40 = 3.75 hours to cover the distance, which is equivalent to 3.75*60 = 225 minutes.

function main() {
    var distance = parseInt(readLine(), 10);
    var speed = 40;

    console.log(distance / speed * 60)
}
